# axon_framework

Axon Framework is a Java framework that provides implementations of the most important building blocks, e.g. aggregates, command and event buses, as well as repositories to help developers apply the CQRS architectural pattern when building applications

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a way of building software systems that separates the part that changes the state from the part that queries the state.
